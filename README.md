## **Code Flow Breakdown**

1. **User Input:**
   - The script prompts the user for the target novelâ€™s URL.

2. **WebDriver Setup:**
   - The tool initializes the Microsoft Edge WebDriver using the `webdriver-manager` library to manage driver installations.

3. **Metadata Scraping:**
   - Navigates the page using defined XPath selectors to extract key metadata.
   - Metadata is saved in a structured text file (`metadata.txt`).

4. **Chapter List Navigation:**
   - Automatically clicks the "Chapter List" button to load the full list of available chapters.

5. **Chapter Extraction:**
   - Captures all chapter links and titles.
   - Stores chapter information in `chapters.json` as a dictionary of titles and URLs.

6. **Data Persistence:**
   - Saves data in plain text and JSON formats for user access.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Built-in exception handling to manage errors during scraping.

}
```

## **Error Handling and Troubleshooting**
- **EdgeDriver Not Found:**
  Ensure Edge is installed, and `pip install webdriver-manager` has been run.
- **Timeout Errors:**
  Increase `time.sleep()` intervals to allow slow-loading pages more time.
- **Invalid XPaths:**
  XPaths may need adjustment if the website structure changes.

---

## **Potential Enhancements**
- Improved error handling with detailed logging.
- Support for additional browsers.
- Multi-threaded chapter scraping for faster performance.
- GUI interface for user-friendly operations.
